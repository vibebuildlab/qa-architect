and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [5.13.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Staged rollout with canary deployment** for consumer repo updates — deploys to canary first, waits for CI green, then rolls out to remaining repos
- **Vercel Blob storage** for webhook handler, replacing filesystem storage

### Fixed

- **CI defaults changed from weekly to monthly** to prevent GitHub Actions minutes burn (#81)
- **Documentation consistency check made non-blocking** (#82)
- Skip Vercel preview deploys for dependabot branches
- Security scan schedule changed from weekly to monthly
- Optimized dependabot config: monthly cadence, limit 2, grouped dependencies

## [5.12.1] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **Critical: Stray gitleaks binary reference in consumer workflows** - Minimal mode regex only matched 2 of 3 restore-key lines, leaving `gitleaks-8.28.0-linux-x64-` embedded in the test run step. This caused all consumer repo CI to fail with "command not found" after tests passed.

### Added

- Regression test for gitleaks stripping in minimal mode (workflow-tiers test 9)
- 77 new tests: ui-helpers (6), setup-enhancements (10), dependency-monitoring-premium (61)

## [5.12.0] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **B-1: Remove dev-only gitleaks test from consumer workflows**: Template now strips gitleaks binary cache and verification steps in minimal mode. Consumer repos no longer reference `tests/gitleaks-real-binary-test.js` which only exists in qa-architect itself.
- **B-3: Fix gitleaks TOML template errors**: Removed overly broad base64-secret rule that caused false positives on 40+ char alphanumeric strings. Fixed invalid `[[rules.allowlist]]` nesting with proper `[allowlist]` section. Added artifact path exclusions.
- **Maturity detection edge case**: Projects with <3 source files but with test files were incorrectly classified as 'minimal' instead of 'bootstrap'. Fixed threshold logic ordering.

### Added

- **Multi-package-manager pre-push audit**: Pre-push hook now detects pnpm/yarn/npm and uses the appropriate audit command
- **Smart test strategy optimization**: HIGH RISK pre-push now runs `test:medium`/`test:fast` instead of `test:comprehensive`, excluding E2E and command tests (CI only)
- **`test:changed` script**: New script for running tests on recently changed files via vitest
- **Smart Strategy Generator tests**: 18 dedicated tests covering all 6 project types, detection priority, custom overrides, and risk patterns
- **Maturity boundary tests**: 17 edge case tests for threshold boundaries, malformed inputs, and GitHub Actions output format

### Changed

- **Workflow tier system**: Minimal mode now strips maturity detection steps from consumer CI for faster runs
- **CI-6 rollout**: Updated 7 consumer projects to 5.12.0 workflow configuration

## [5.11.3] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Auto-install commitlint dependencies**: Commitlint dependencies now automatically added to package.json
  - Added `commitlint`, `@commitlint/cli`, `@commitlint/config-conventional` to baseDevDependencies
  - Updated commitlint versions from ^19.0.0 to ^20.4.1
  - Fixes issue where commit-msg hook would fail because dependencies weren't installed
  - Previously, commitlint hook was created but dependencies were only added if quality tools were enabled
  - Now all projects get commitlint dependencies automatically during setup

## [5.11.2] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **GitHub Actions Cost Reduction (~50%)**: Skip Quality Checks for Dependabot PRs
  - Added `if: github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'` condition to detect-maturity job
  - Dependabot PRs auto-merge based on their own checks, no need for duplicate CI
  - Reduces workflow runs by ~50% on repos with active Dependabot
- **Updated CI Cost Analysis**: Replaced inaccurate estimates with actual January data
  - Old doc claimed 77,000 mins/month (was 100x off)
  - Actual usage: ~2,400 mins/month
  - Main cost driver identified: Dependabot PR spam (56% of all runs)

## [5.11.1] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

- **Husky v9/v10 Compatibility**: Removed deprecated `husky.sh` references from all generated hooks
  - Removed `#!/bin/sh` + `. husky.sh` source lines from generated pre-commit and pre-push hooks
  - Fixes deprecation warnings in Husky v9 and prevents breakage in v10
  - Affects `setup.js` and `lib/smart-strategy-generator.js`
- **Security**: Fixed high-severity `tar` vulnerability (bumped to 7.5.7)

## [5.11.0] - 2026-01-27

### Changed

- **Layered Testing Strategy**: Implemented industry best practice "fail fast locally, verify comprehensively remotely"
  - Pre-commit: lint + format staged files (<5s)
  - Pre-push: type check + tests on changed files (<30s)
  - CI: full test suite + security (3-10 min)
  - CI no longer re-runs lint/format (pre-commit already did it)
- **Simplified Tier System**: Removed Team/Enterprise tiers (FREE + PRO only)

### Fixed

- Removed lighthouse from CLI project (web-app-only tool)
- Disabled false-positive security ESLint rules for CLI context
- Resolved all 23 ESLint no-unused-vars errors
- Updated gitleaks config for v8 compatibility

  - Affects projects without local `lib/project-maturity.js` (all projects except qa-architect itself)
  - Test added to verify dependency installation order
- **Workflow Package Manager Support**: Added pnpm and bun setup steps to all workflow jobs
  - GitHub Actions runners only have npm and yarn 1.x pre-installed (pnpm and bun are missing)
  - Added conditional "Setup pnpm" step (version 8.15.0) to all 6 jobs when pnpm is detected
  - Added conditional "Setup Bun" step (version 1.0.0) to all 6 jobs when bun is detected
  - Jobs: detect-maturity, core-checks, linting, security, tests, documentation
  - Fixes "pnpm: command not found" and "bun: command not found" errors in workflows
  - Test updated to verify all jobs have both pnpm and bun setup with correct version formats

## [5.10.3] - 2026-01-19

## [5.9.1] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed

- **Workflow Path Resolution**: Fixed quality.yml template to support both local and node_modules file paths
  - Workflow now checks for files locally first (for qa-architect itself), then falls back to `node_modules/create-qa-architect/` (for projects using the tool)

## [5.9.0] - 2026-01-16

### Changed

- **Licensing Simplification**: Removed TEAM and ENTERPRISE tiers
  - Simplified to FREE + PRO two-tier model (TEAM/ENTERPRISE were marked "coming soon" but never implemented)
  - Removed 244 lines of unused code (RBAC, SSO, SAML, Slack integration, multi-repo dashboard, audit logging)

  - Updated: lib/licensing.js (tiers, features, upgrade messages), webhook-handler.js (Stripe prices), admin-license.js
  - Updated tests: removed TEAM/ENTERPRISE test cases, fixed security tampering tests
  - Updated documentation: README.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/, .serena/memories
  - Result: Clean two-tier architecture with no unimplemented features

## [5.8.0] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed

- **Lighthouse CI Failures**: Lighthouse failures now explicitly fail builds for production-ready projects
  - Added failure reporting step that logs errors and adds job summary
  - Production-ready projects must pass Lighthouse checks (hard gate)
  - Other maturity levels show warnings but don't block (soft failure)
  - Prevents performance regressions, accessibility issues, and SEO problems from merging silently

- **Job Summary Accuracy**: Quality check summary now shows actual pass/fail results instead of just "enabled"
  - Uses `needs.<job>.result` to check actual job outcomes
  - Shows ✅ for success, ❌ for failure, ⏭️ for skipped, ⚠️ for cancelled
  - Prevents misleading "all green" summaries when checks actually failed

### Changed

- **ESLint Configuration**: Fixed unsafe regex warnings in workflow-config.js with proper disable comments

## [5.7.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added

  - Keeps: Full test suite + build verification + weekly security scan
  - Expected savings: 60-85% reduction in CI minutes usage
- **Workflow Mode Marker**: Added `# WORKFLOW_MODE: minimal` marker to quality.yml
  - Makes it easy to detect which tier is active
  - Preserves placeholder system for mode switching

### Fixed

- **CI Cost Efficiency**: Addresses GitHub Actions usage exceeding free tier limits
  - Before: ~7,260 min/month across multiple repos
  - After: ~700-1,000 min/month (85-90% reduction)
  - Strategy: Move validation to local pre-push, keep CI as safety net

## [4.0.0] - 2025-11-20

### Added

#### 🎯 Progressive Quality Automation

**Major new feature:** Adaptive quality checks that automatically adjust based on project maturity, eliminating false failures in early-stage projects.

- **Project Maturity Detection** (`lib/project-maturity.js`)
  - Auto-detects 4 maturity levels: minimal, bootstrap, development, production-ready
  - Counts source files, test files, CSS files
  - Detects documentation presence and dependencies
  - CLI command: `npx create-qa-architect@latest --check-maturity`
  - GitHub Actions compatible output format (`--github-actions`)
  - 84%+ code coverage with 23 comprehensive tests

- **Progressive Workflow** (`.github/workflows/quality.yml`)
  - **Minimal projects** (0 source files): Only Prettier runs
  - **Bootstrap projects** (1-2 files): + ESLint
  - **Development projects** (3+ files + tests): + Tests + Security audits
  - **Production-ready** (10+ files + docs): All checks enabled
  - Conditional job execution saves CI time and eliminates noise
  - Summary job reports what checks ran and why in PR summaries

- **Manual Override Support** (`.qualityrc.json`)
  - Auto-generated during setup with detected maturity
  - Set `maturity: "production-ready"` to force all checks
  - Set `maturity: "minimal"` to disable most checks
  - Per-check `enabled: true/false/"auto"` configuration
  - Tracks detection metadata (source count, test count, detected timestamp)

- **Existing Project Migration**
  - `--update` flag automatically upgrades to progressive workflow
  - Generates `.qualityrc.json` with current project state
  - Zero breaking changes - auto-detection ensures smooth transition
  - Old workflow preserved as `.github/workflows/quality-legacy.yml.backup`

### Changed

- **Default workflow** is now progressive (was strict)
  - New projects get adaptive checks by default
  - Early-stage projects no longer fail CI with false negatives
  - Old behavior available via `.qualityrc.json` manual override

- **Setup process** now includes maturity detection
  - Shows detected level during setup
  - Generates `.qualityrc.json` automatically
  - Explains which checks will run at current maturity level

### Fixed

- Early-stage projects failing CI/CD checks unnecessarily
- Noise from checks on projects without assets (tests, docs, dependencies)
- Unclear which failures matter vs. expected for project stage

### Testing

- Added 23 comprehensive tests (84.71% statement coverage, 93.33% function coverage)
  - `tests/project-maturity.test.js` - 15 unit tests for maturity detection
  - `tests/project-maturity-cli.test.js` - 8 CLI integration tests
  - Tests all 4 maturity levels with realistic project structures
  - Tests edge cases (no package.json, nested files, TypeScript, multiple test locations)

### Documentation

- `.github/PROGRESSIVE_QUALITY_PROPOSAL.md` - Full design document (200+ lines)
- `.github/PROGRESSIVE_QUALITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Integration guide with testing scenarios
- `QUALITY_CHECKS_OVERVIEW.md` - Current check breakdown and workflows
- `QUALITY_CHECKS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Visual flow diagrams
- `QUALITY_CHECKS_MATRIX.md` - Failure matrix with debugging commands

### Upgrading

**For new projects:** No action needed - progressive checks are default

**For existing projects:**

```bash
# Option 1: Update your configuration (recommended)
npx create-qa-architect@latest --update

# Option 2: Check your maturity level
npx create-qa-architect@latest --check-maturity

# Option 3: Force strict mode (disable progressive)
# Edit .qualityrc.json: set "maturity": "production-ready"
```

**Breaking Changes:** None - auto-detection ensures backward compatibility

---

## [3.1.1] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed

- **🐛 Critical Python Parser Bug Fixes**
  - **HIGH: PEP 621 list-style dependencies never parsed** - Modern Python projects using `dependencies = ["package>=1.0.0"]` format had zero dependencies detected, losing all premium features (Dependabot grouping, framework detection). Parser only matched legacy `package = "^1.0.0"` format.
  - **HIGH: Inline comments after `]` break PEP 621 parsing** - Files with `]  # end of dependencies` failed to parse, returning empty dependency list.
  - **MEDIUM: Dotted package names rejected** - Python namespace packages (`zope.interface`, `google.cloud-storage`, `backports.zoneinfo`, `ruamel.yaml`) were parsed as truncated names (`zope`, `google`) with empty versions, breaking framework detection for scientific/cloud packages.
  - **MEDIUM: Metadata pollution** - Key/value parser treated `[project.urls]` homepage values and other metadata as dependencies, polluting framework counts and Dependabot configuration.

- **📦 Python Parser Enhancements**
  - Support PEP 621 main `dependencies = [...]` arrays
  - Support `[project.optional-dependencies]` with hyphenated group names (`lint-tools`, `test-suite`, `docs-build`)
  - Support dotted package names (`.` in package identifiers)
  - Support package extras (`fastapi[all]>=0.110.0`, `uvicorn[standard]>=0.24.0`)
  - Handle inline comments after closing brackets and within dependency lists
  - Scope legacy key/value parsing to dependency sections only (exclude `[project.urls]`, `[build-system]`, etc.)
  - Skip Python version specifiers (`python = "^3.8"`)

### Added

- **🧪 Comprehensive Python Parser Test Suites**
  - `tests/python-parser-fixes.test.js`: 8 test scenarios covering PEP 621, dotted packages, hyphenated groups, real-world files (540+ lines)
  - `tests/pyproject-parser-bug-reproduction.test.js`: Bug reproduction tests (235 lines)
  - Test coverage: PEP 621 arrays, dotted names, optional-dependencies, inline comments, metadata exclusion, edge cases

- **📚 Process Improvement Documentation**
  - `claudedocs/parser-bugs-lessons-learned.md`: Systematic process improvements for future parser work
  - `claudedocs/bug3-monorepo-subdirectory-design.md`: Design document for deferred monorepo subdirectory detection (v3.2.0)
  - Research protocol for pre-implementation edge case discovery
  - Real-world test data methodology

### Notes

- **Monorepo subdirectory detection** (Bug #3) deferred to v3.2.0 - requires architectural changes
- Workaround: Run CLI in each service directory manually (`cd services/api && npx create-qa-architect --deps`)
- All 22+ test suites passing with new parser fixes

- **Path sanitization for --template flag** - Template directory paths now preserve special characters (`&`, `<`, `>`, etc.) that are valid in file paths
  - Previously: `validateAndSanitizeInput` stripped these characters, breaking legitimate paths like "ACME & Co"
  - Now: Template path read from raw CLI args before sanitization

## [2.6.1] - 2025-11-12

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Workflow validation steps using conditional setup.js checks that always fall back to weaker validation
  - Configuration security check now uses `npx create-qa-architect@latest --security-config`
  - Documentation validation now uses `npx create-qa-architect@latest --validate-docs`
  - Previously: `if [ -f "setup.js" ]` was always false in consumer repos, silently falling back to basic grep checks
  - Impact: Consumer repos now get comprehensive validation instead of weak fallback checks
- **📖 README accuracy**: Removed "Auto-merge for security patches only" claim from Dependabot feature list
  - Auto-merge is NOT included in basic Dependabot configuration
  - Added note that auto-merge requires manual GitHub Actions workflow setup

- **.eslintignore missing from npm package** - Added to files array
- **Invalid Dependabot config schema** - Removed unsupported `update-type` keys
- Removed .npmrc from files array (npm excludes it automatically)

### Changed

- Enhanced prerelease checks to include E2E package validation

- **🛡️ Better Error Messages:** Centralized error formatting for ENOENT, EACCES, MODULE_NOT_FOUND with context-aware messages

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL**: ESLint security validation now properly fails when ESLint binary is missing instead of silently passing (resolves false positive security gates)
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: TypeScript projects using `eslint.config.ts.cjs` are now properly scanned (previously invisible to security scanner)
- **📖 Documentation Validation:** Implemented promised README file/script reference validation that was advertised but not implemented
- **🪟 Cross-platform Testing:** Replaced Unix-only `rm -rf` with `fs.rmSync()` for Windows compatibility

  - Users can use `--no-gitleaks` flag to explicitly skip if desired

---

## [2.3.2] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Fixed gitleaks error swallowing that caused false positives
  - Previous version silently ignored gitleaks failures (missing binary, permissions, etc.)
  - Security validation would pass with "✅ Security checks passed" even when gitleaks never ran
  - Now properly surfaces failures: info message for missing binary, blocking errors for other issues

---

## [2.3.1] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Fixed gitleaks invocation to use `npx` instead of `which` + bare command
  - Previous version silently skipped secret scanning on Windows and local npm installs
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Fixed actionlint invocation to use `npx` instead of `which` + bare command
  - Previous version silently skipped workflow validation on Windows and local npm installs

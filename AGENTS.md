# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**npm**: `create-qa-architect` | **Version**: see `package.json` (`version` field — source of truth)

## Project Overview

QA Architect is a CLI tool (`create-qa-architect`) that bootstraps quality automation for JS/TS/Python/Shell script projects. One command adds ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged, and GitHub Actions. Free includes the local audit and basic working-tree security gate; Pro adds advanced/full-history security scanning, evidence-backed test impact, verified remediation, release assurance, and multi-language support.

## Commands

```bash
# Development
npm test                    # Run all tests (40+ test files)
npm run test:unit           # Fast unit tests only
npm run test:slow           # Integration tests (Python, monorepo, etc.)
npm run test:coverage       # Coverage report (75% lines, 70% functions required)
npm run lint                # ESLint + Stylelint
npm run format              # Prettier

# Run single test file
NODE_ENV=test QAA_DEVELOPER=true node tests/licensing.test.js
NODE_ENV=test QAA_DEVELOPER=true node tests/workflow-tiers.test.js
NODE_ENV=test QAA_DEVELOPER=true node tests/setup.test.js

# Validation
npm run validate:all        # Full validation suite
npm run prerelease          # Required before publishing

# CLI testing
npx . --dry-run             # Test setup without changes
npx . --check-maturity      # Show project maturity detection
npx . --validate            # Run validation checks
npx . --workflow-minimal    # Test minimal CI setup (default)
npx . --workflow-standard   # Test standard CI setup
npx . --workflow-comprehensive  # Test comprehensive CI setup
npx . --analyze-ci          # Analyze GitHub Actions costs (Pro)
```

### License Tiers

- **FREE**: Local security audit, basic linting/formatting, 1 private repo, 50 pre-push runs/month
- **PRO**: Advanced/full-history security scanning, verified remediation, release assurance, evidence-backed test impact, unlimited
- Check tier: `hasFeature('smartTestStrategy')` or `getLicenseInfo()` in `lib/licensing.js`

### Workflow Tiers

Defaults to **minimal CI** to avoid unexpected GitHub Actions costs. Selectable via `--workflow-minimal/standard/comprehensive`. See `docs/CI-COST-ANALYSIS.md` and `tests/workflow-tiers.test.js`.

### Template-as-Product Contract

`quality.yml` is both qa-architect's own CI AND the template deployed to 15+ consumer repos. Key invariants:

- Never reference `node_modules/create-qa-architect` or `@latest` in templates.
  Consumers execute the exact package version from `package.json`.
- Blocking security jobs use the digest-pinned official Semgrep image with
  `scan --error`; do not restore the deprecated action or runtime package installs.
- Never use `\s*` in YAML cleanup regexes — use `[ \t]*` (prevents line collapse)
- Conditional content uses section markers (`# {{NAME_BEGIN/END}}`) stripped by `stripSection()`
- `CONSUMER_FORBIDDEN_CONTENT` in `consumer-workflow-integration.test.js` gates consumer output
- Validate: `node tests/consumer-workflow-integration.test.js` | Prepare canary PR: `./scripts/deploy-consumers.sh --canary <repo> --canary-only --pr`

## Key Files

- `setup.js:390-500` - Main entry, interactive mode handling
- `setup.js:985-2143` - Core setup flow (`runMainSetup`)
- `lib/licensing.js` - All tier logic, usage caps, feature gates
- `lib/project-maturity.js` - Maturity detection algorithm
- `config/defaults.js` - Default scripts, dependencies, lint-staged config

## Quality Gates

Coverage: 75% lines / 70% functions / 65% branches. Pre-commit: staged lint and format. Pre-push: lint, format, secret scan, and a production dependency audit only when dependency files changed. PR and push CI use `.buildproven/test-impact.json`; scheduled, manual, migration, selector-policy, and release audits use the complete suite. Run focused mapped tests during development and `npm run prerelease` before a release.

## Publishing

**Uses GitHub trusted publishing — do NOT run `npm publish` manually.** Push version bump to `main`; `release.yml` handles npm publish automatically (no OTP needed). After publishing, validate a named canary and prepare its protected PR with `./scripts/deploy-consumers.sh --canary <repo> --canary-only --pr`.

## Coding Style & Testing Conventions

- JavaScript (Node.js) — no TypeScript
- Tests use real filesystem operations with temp directories via `createTempGitRepo()` helper
- Use `QAA_DEVELOPER=true` env var to bypass license checks during testing
- Never use `\s*` in YAML cleanup regexes — use `[ \t]*` (avoids cross-line collapse)
- `quality.yml` is both the project's own CI and the template deployed to 15+ consumer repos — treat every change as a multi-repo product deployment
- Feature branch before any code changes — pre-commit hooks enforce this

## Agent Workflow

Session start: read `docs/dev_guide/CONVENTIONS.md`. Planning: `/bs:plan <name>` → `docs/plans/`. Handoff: `/bs:context --save` / `--resume`.

## Shipping Policy

This project is solo-owned. The shipping rule is **review/test thoroughly → then merge** — not "wait for the owner to approve every PR." Claude is expected to act as the reviewer/tester a collaborator would, not gate trivially on the owner.

For Claude (or any agent) working in this repo:

1. **Do the review yourself.** Read your own diff line by line before declaring done. Look for: incorrect logic, broken refs, missed cleanups, security issues, hardcoded paths/secrets, copy-paste errors, behavior changes outside the stated scope.
2. **Run the gates.** `npm test`, `npm run lint`, smoke-test where feasible. Don't claim "tests pass" without running them on the branch.
3. **Then push and merge** — open a PR or merge to main on your own. Don't ask "want me to push?" for routine work that's been reviewed and tested.
4. **Still ask before:**
   - Force-push, `reset --hard`, branch deletes
   - Anything touching shared/external state (Stripe/Polar dashboards, prod deploys, npm publish — the existing `release.yml` handles that automatically anyway)
   - Anything that costs real money
   - Genuine judgment calls that can't be resolved from code/context after investigation
5. **Hooks must run** unless they're physically broken (e.g., sandbox-wrapped git). If a hook fails, fix the issue rather than bypassing. If you must bypass, document why in the commit message.

# QA Architect

**Every AI-built release gets a receipt. QA Architect binds security, test,
remediation, and runtime evidence to the exact candidate under review.**

Create a Pro Release Receipt with a `PASS`, `BLOCK`, or `INCOMPLETE` verdict:

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest receipt create \
  --base-sha <40-character-base-commit> \
  --head "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --artifact-dir /tmp/release-receipt
```

Or start with the free security audit:

```bash
# Scan your project for security issues (free)
npx create-qa-architect@latest --audit
```

```

  QA Architect — Vibe-Code Security Audit
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  🚨 BLOCKING FINDINGS DETECTED

  Total findings: 7
  🚨 Critical: 2
  ❌ High:     3
  ⚠️  Medium:   2

  🚨 CRITICAL (2)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  pages/api/users.js:44
  Prisma query by ID from request params with no user ownership filter.
  → Fix: findUnique({ where: { id: params.id, userId: session.user.id } })

  lib/auth.js:12
  JWT signed without an expiry option — stolen token = permanent access.
  → Fix: jwt.sign(payload, secret, { expiresIn: '24h' })
```

QA Architect reports supported patterns and evidence boundaries. A clean scan is not proof that an application is vulnerability-free.

## What It Does

**Free tier — `--audit`:**

Runs [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) SAST, npm CVE audit, and direct production dependency provenance analysis against your codebase and produces a prioritized security report. Covers the most common vibe-coding vulnerability categories — including AI-native classes generic SAST misses, like secrets shipped in the client bundle and unscoped data access (IDOR) across Prisma, Drizzle, and Supabase:

| Category                                                                      | Coverage            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Secrets exposure (hardcoded keys, JWT without expiry)                         | ✅ Free             |
| Secrets in the client bundle (NEXT*PUBLIC*/VITE\_ secrets, service keys)      | ✅ Free             |
| Unscoped data access / IDOR (Prisma, Drizzle, Supabase query by request id)   | ✅ Free             |
| Auth & authorization gaps (missing checks, client-side auth)                  | ✅ Free             |
| Injection vectors (SQL injection, command injection, prototype pollution)     | ✅ Free             |
| Production misconfigs (CORS-all, verbose errors, debug mode, missing headers) | ✅ Free             |
| XSS patterns (unsafe HTML, dynamic hrefs)                                     | ✅ Free             |
| Dependency CVEs                                                               | ✅ Free (npm audit) |
| Direct production dependency source + npm registry evidence                   | ✅ Free             |
| Package-age and name-confusion review signals                                 | 🔒 Pro              |

**Pro tier — Release Receipt and verified remediation:**

`--audit --fix` exports an inspectable, agent-neutral packet for each supported Critical/High Semgrep finding; nothing is sent to a provider. Dependency-CVE findings remain report-only. `--repair-with codex|claude --finding <id>` explicitly sends the selected packet and its redacted surrounding source context to that provider over stdin, then runs the adapter in a dedicated branch/worktree. Review the exported packet before invoking a provider. A repair is labeled `VERIFIED` only after the exact finding disappears, a regression-test delta is present when behavior is testable, focused tests pass, adjacent blocking findings do not increase, and evidence is bound to the resulting commit.

Pro also adds explicitly labeled, low-confidence package-age and name-confusion signals. Registry 404s remain registry facts—not claims that a package is malicious, hallucinated, or typo-squatting. The current policy flags packages first published within 30 days and names one insertion, deletion, substitution, or adjacent transposition from a versioned built-in protected-name list. JSON and SARIF output include the policy version, confidence, registry, lookup time, response state, and coverage limitations so automation can distinguish facts from heuristics.

**Also included:**

- **Release Receipt** (`receipt create`) — derives required checks from the exact change, workflow tier, stack/configuration, and QA Architect risk policy; emits revision-bound JSON and Markdown with a PASS/BLOCK/INCOMPLETE verdict
- **Changed-code PR assurance** (`--pr-check`) — exact-head Semgrep gate with baselines, SARIF annotations, and revision-bound evidence
- **AI SaaS Authorization Pack** — adds explicit opt-in preview and two-user authorization evidence to the receipt, with revision binding, production-host refusal, and bounded cleanup
- **Full-history secrets scan** (`--history-scan`) — gitleaks across entire git history
- **Quality bootstrap** — one command adds ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged, GitHub Actions

Create a Release Receipt for an exact candidate:

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest receipt create \
  --base-sha <40-character-base-commit> \
  --head "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --artifact-dir /tmp/release-receipt
```

Receipt creation runs every risk-required check independently and binds its identity to
the base/head commits, binary diff, risk policy, relevant configuration, rule
pack, commands, results, and referenced PR/remediation evidence. A required
check that is skipped, unavailable, timed out, or stale yields `INCOMPLETE`.
Check the saved receipt later against the same local checkout and configuration:

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest receipt check-freshness \
  /tmp/release-receipt/release-receipt.json
```

The freshness check detects local revision, policy, rule-pack, input, reference,
and preview-configuration changes. It does not authenticate the receipt
producer, prove that checks ran in trusted infrastructure, or make the
self-hashed artifact tamper-proof. Independent authenticity requires a signed or
CI-attested receipt, which is not part of the current product.

Reproduce the required PR check locally against an exact revision:

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest --pr-check \
  --base-sha <40-character-base-commit> \
  --head "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --artifact-dir /tmp/qa-architect-assurance
```

Both assurance commands exit `0` only for `PASS`, `1` for `BLOCK`, and `2` for
`INCOMPLETE`. Optional checked-in `.qa-architect-pr-assurance.json` policy can
set the Semgrep timeout and project-relative path exclusions. Baselines,
waivers, blocking severities, and required checks remain in the separate
`.qa-architect-assurance.json` contract. Pro workflow generation adds a
least-privilege `pr-assurance` job; configure the repository secret
`QAA_LICENSE_JSON`, then require that check in branch protection.

The generated [assurance rule catalog](docs/ASSURANCE-RULE-CATALOG.md) states
the exact Web SaaS pack boundary, fixture-measured rules, safe patterns,
verification steps, and known false-positive/false-negative limitations. A
clean static scan is not a framework-security, tenant-isolation, or payments
certification.

Opt in to deployed-preview checks by passing an origin and a versioned config:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0.0",
  "deployment": { "revisionHeader": "x-deployment-commit" },
  "publicPaths": ["/", "/health"],
  "privatePaths": [
    { "path": "/dashboard", "unauthenticatedStatuses": [401, 403, 404] }
  ],
  "debugPaths": ["/.env", "/__debug", "/_next/static/chunks/main.js.map"],
  "redirectProbePath": "/login?next=https://attacker.invalid",
  "errorProbePath": "/api/error-probe"
}
```

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest receipt create \
  --base-sha <40-character-base-commit> \
  --head "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --preview-url https://my-branch.example.vercel.app \
  --preview-config .qa-architect-preview.json \
  --json
```

The strict `preview-assurance-v1` config declares public and private paths,
optional debug/redirect/error paths, and the response header that binds the
deployment to the expected commit. Missing revision metadata is reported as
`INCOMPLETE`, never as a verified pass. The read-only probes issue only `GET`
requests and check TLS, security headers, unexpected debug/source-map routes,
cross-origin redirects, error leakage, and expected public/private behavior.

An optional two-user authorization probe is state-changing. It runs only when
the config contains the exact `state-changing-preview-probe-v1` consent string
and the command also includes `--allow-preview-mutations`. Tokens are read from
the configured environment-variable names. The probe creates one synthetic
resource as user A, attempts the configured read and mutation as user B, and
then sends the configured cleanup request as user A for only the exact returned
resource ID. Authentication, network, and cleanup failures are `INCOMPLETE`.
Production-like hosts are refused unless both the config sets
`allowProduction: true` and the command includes
`--allow-production-preview`.

Evidence stores request method/origin/path/query-key names, status, safe header
names, timestamps, durations, byte counts, and body/identifier hashes. It does
not store authorization headers, tokens, request bodies, response bodies, PII,
raw resource IDs, or raw deployment IDs. This is bounded verification, not DAST
crawling, uptime monitoring, or permission for autonomous production testing.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install semgrep (required for --audit)
pip install semgrep          # or: brew install semgrep

# 2. Run security audit (free)
npx create-qa-architect@latest --audit

# 3. Write report to file (for docs or PR comments)
npx create-qa-architect@latest --audit --out audit-report.md

# 4. Export inspectable remediation packets (Pro; no provider transmission)
npx create-qa-architect@latest --audit --fix --remediation-out ./qaa-remediation

# 5. Explicitly repair one finding with a local adapter and verify the result
npx create-qa-architect@latest --audit --repair-with codex --finding <rule-id>
```

**Suppressing a false positive:** if a finding is a confirmed false positive (or
a true positive you've reviewed and accepted), add an inline `// nosemgrep`
comment on the offending line — the audit honors it and won't re-flag it:

```js
const mod = require(modulePath) // nosemgrep — path is hardcoded, not user input
```

This suppresses one line surgically instead of disabling the whole rule.

## Target Users

### Release Confidence by Tier

Pro is the recurring merge-and-release workflow: it binds required checks,
findings, remediation evidence, and the exact candidate revision into a
Release Receipt with a PASS/BLOCK/INCOMPLETE result. The audit is the free acquisition
surface; Pro is the evidence and repair loop used on every meaningful change.

| Feature                              | Free | Pro |
| ------------------------------------ | ---- | --- |
| Release Receipt (release-readiness)  | ❌   | ✅  |
| PR Risk Check (diff classifier)      | ❌   | ✅  |
| CI Doctor (workflow waste detection) | ❌   | ✅  |
| Evidence-backed affected tests       | ❌   | ✅  |
| Full-history secrets scan            | ❌   | ✅  |

### Quality Tools by Tier

| Feature                      | Free | Pro+ |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Lighthouse CI (basic scores) | ✅   | ✅   |
| Lighthouse thresholds        | ❌   | ✅   |
| axe-core accessibility       | ✅   | ✅   |
| Conventional commits         | ✅   | ✅   |
| Bundle size limits           | ❌   | ✅   |
| Coverage thresholds          | ❌   | ✅   |

Coverage thresholds measure exercised code, not whether a test would fail when
behavior regresses. Comprehensive workflows also run a project-provided
`test:mutation` command when present; teams should use it for mutation or
behavioral-relevance checks rather than treating percentage coverage as proof.

### Pre-Launch Validation by Tier

| Feature             | Free | Pro+ |

## Workflow Tiers (GitHub Actions Cost Optimization)

qa-architect follows industry best practice: **"Fail fast locally, verify comprehensively remotely"**

### The Testing Pyramid

| Layer          | Time     | What Runs                          | Why                        |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Pre-commit** | < 5s     | Lint + format (staged files)       | Instant feedback           |
| **Pre-push**   | < 30s    | Type check + tests (changed files) | Catches bugs before push   |
| **CI**         | 3-10 min | Full test suite + security         | Comprehensive verification |

Note: CI does NOT re-run lint/format (pre-commit already did it). This avoids redundant work and reduces CI costs.

### Workflow Tiers (GitHub Actions Cost)

qa-architect defaults to **minimal CI** to avoid unexpected GitHub Actions bills. Choose the tier that matches your needs:

### Minimal (Default) - Budget-First (<1000 min/month target)

**Best for:** Solo developers, side projects, open source

- Single Node version (22) detection workflow
- CI defaults to detection-only (tests/security/docs disabled in minimal mode)
- Security scans run monthly (not on every commit)
- Path filters skip CI for docs/README changes
- **Runtime:** ~1-2 min/run
- **Est. usage target:** under ~1000 minutes/month by default

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest
# or explicitly:
npx create-qa-architect@latest --workflow-minimal
```

### Standard - $5-20/month

**Best for:** Small teams, client projects, production apps

- Single Node 22 testing **only on main branch**
- Security scans run monthly
- Path filters enabled
- **Runtime:** ~15-20 min/commit
- **Est. cost:** ~$5-20/mo for typical projects

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest --workflow-standard
```

### Comprehensive - $100-350/month

**Best for:** High-compliance projects, large teams

- Matrix testing (Node 20 + 22) on **every commit**
- Security scans inline (every commit)
- No path filters (runs on all changes)
- **Runtime:** ~50-100 min/commit
- **Est. cost:** ~$100-350/mo for typical projects

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest --workflow-comprehensive
```

### Matrix Testing for Libraries

**Publishing an npm package or CLI tool?** Use `--matrix` to test on multiple Node.js versions:

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest --matrix
```

This adds Node.js 20 + 22 matrix testing - recommended for published packages that support multiple runtime versions. Not needed for web apps you deploy (you control the Node version).

### Switching Between Tiers

Already using qa-architect? Convert to minimal to reduce costs:

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest --update --workflow-minimal
```

### ⚠️ Avoid Duplicate Workflows

**qa-architect's `quality.yml` is designed to be your single CI workflow.** Do not use it alongside a separate `ci.yml` - this causes:

- **2-3x CI minutes usage** (both workflows run on every push)
- **Duplicate checks** (ESLint, tests, security scans run twice)
- **Unexpected billing** (easily exceeds GitHub's 2,000 min/month free tier)

**If you have both `ci.yml` and `quality.yml`, run:**

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest --update --workflow-minimal
```

`--update` now automatically removes known duplicate workflow names (`ci.yml`, `test.yml`, `tests.yml`, `quality-legacy.yml`) while preserving `quality.yml`.

The `quality.yml` workflow is adaptive - it runs appropriate checks based on your project's maturity level, so a separate `ci.yml` is unnecessary.

### Analyzing Your Costs (Pro Feature)

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest --analyze-ci
```

Shows estimated GitHub Actions usage and provides optimization recommendations.

### Generating affected-test policy (Pro feature)

Inspect the repository first. This command changes no file:

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest --test-impact-plan
```

Write the repository policy:

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest --write-test-impact
```

Update the policy while preserving reviewed repository mappings:

```bash
npx create-qa-architect@latest --update-test-impact
```

The generator supports declared Vitest, Jest, plain Node, and Pytest suites.
Unknown impact uses the declared complete suite as an explicit safe fallback.
Mapped, related-test, direct-test, and documentation-only changes stay focused.
Plain Node same-name tests are suggestions only. Supply reviewed mappings
with `--mapping-file <path>`. QA Architect does not install or replace CI for
this feature. Use the shared `claude-kit` selector through the repository's
normal `claude-setup` CI adapter. The generated pre-push hook stays fast and
does not run the complete suite.

On update, QA Architect replaces only a recognized legacy smart-test hook. It
saves the old hook as `.husky/pre-push.qa-architect-legacy`. Restore that file
as `.husky/pre-push` to roll back. Custom hooks are not changed.

## Pro Tier & Billing

The marketing/checkout page source lives in the
[repository landing-page directory](https://github.com/buildproven/qa-architect/tree/main/docs/landing).

### Pro launch status

Pro tier ($29/mo or $290/yr) includes:

- **Release-confidence gates**: Release Receipt, PR Risk Check, CI Doctor, full-history secrets scan
- Security scanning (Gitleaks + ESLint security rules)
- Evidence-backed affected-test policy generation
- Multi-language support (Python, Rust, Ruby, and Shell scripts)
- Unlimited private repos and runs

Paid checkout is not open. Join the
[Pro launch list](mailto:support@buildproven.ai?subject=QA%20Architect%20Pro%20launch%20list)
for availability updates. This does not create a subscription or issue a key.

### Server-Side Setup (Maintainers Only)

This repository contains a legacy Polar webhook implementation for operators
who deploy their own instance. It is not evidence of BuildProven's current
production payment authority. If you use this reference implementation:

1. Set up webhook handler (see `webhook-handler.js`)
2. Configure Polar.sh products and webhook secret
3. Deploy to production server (Vercel)

See the [Polar deployment guide](https://github.com/buildproven/qa-architect/blob/main/docs/POLAR-DEPLOYMENT.md)
for the complete setup guide.

24–48 hours. For reproducible product defects, include the CLI output and open

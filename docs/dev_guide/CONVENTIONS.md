## What This Project Does

QA Architect (`create-qa-architect`) is a CLI tool that bootstraps quality automation for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and shell script projects. One command installs ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged, and GitHub Actions. Free includes the local audit and basic working-tree security gate; Pro adds advanced/full-history security scanning, evidence-backed test impact, verified remediation, release assurance, and multi-language support. The legacy risk heuristic is not installed.

**Tech stack:** Node.js (CommonJS, no build step) · Vanilla JS (no framework) · GitHub Actions templates · c8 for coverage · Playwright for E2E

**Entry point:** `setup.js` — CLI argument parsing and orchestration. Run as `npx create-qa-architect` or `node setup.js`.

**npm package:** `create-qa-architect` (version in `package.json` — published via GitHub trusted publishing)

## Conventions

**Language:** Plain JavaScript (CommonJS). No TypeScript in the main source. `QAA_DEVELOPER=true` env var bypasses license checks in tests.

**Naming:** kebab-case files, camelCase functions/vars. Test files: `tests/[feature].test.js`.

**Feature addition pattern:**

1. Add feature gate check in `lib/licensing.js` if Pro-only
2. Implement in appropriate `lib/` module
3. Wire into `setup.js` argument parsing if it needs a CLI flag
4. Add test file: `tests/[feature].test.js` using Node `assert` module
5. Add to the `npm test` chain in `package.json`

**Template-as-Product contract** — `quality.yml` is BOTH qa-architect's own CI AND the template deployed to 15+ consumer repos. Rules:

- Never reference `node_modules/create-qa-architect` or `@latest` in templates.
  Consumers execute the exact package version from `package.json`.
- Blocking security jobs use the digest-pinned official Semgrep image with
  `scan --error`; do not restore the deprecated action or runtime package installs.
- Never use `\s*` in YAML cleanup regexes — use `[ \t]*` (avoids newline collapse)
- Conditional content uses `# {{NAME_BEGIN/END}}` section markers, stripped by `stripSection()`
- `CONSUMER_FORBIDDEN_CONTENT` in `consumer-workflow-integration.test.js` is a hard gate

**Workflow tiers:**

- Minimal (default): single Node 22, weekly security, path filters (~$0-5/mo)
- Standard: single Node 22, tests on main only (~$5-10/mo)
- Comprehensive: matrix every commit (~$100-350/mo)

**Consumer project profiling:**

- `lib/project-profile.js` is the source of truth for package manager, framework,
  existing quality scripts/configuration, submodules, and build outputs.
- Setup must preserve real project scripts and formatter/linter configuration.
  Do not add a second ESLint configuration or a placeholder test framework when
  the consumer already has tests.
- Generated hooks and workflows must use the detected package manager and its
  declared version. Minimal CI retains real maturity/test detection; it must
  never authorize skipping tests by hardcoding a zero test count.
- `packageManager` is authoritative. A conflicting lockfile or multiple
  package-manager lockfiles is a setup error, not a condition to guess through.
- Package-manager versions and semantics travel with the profile: pnpm and
  modern Yarn are activated through Corepack before setup-node caching, Bun
  uses `bun.lock`/`bun.lockb`, `bun x` for package executables, and the declared
  Bun version in CI. Yarn 1 and Yarn 2+ use their respective install and audit
  command families.
- Consumer CI runs only scripts the profile actually found, in the order lint,
  format check, type check, tests, and build. Test files without a test script
  must not cause QA Architect to invent `npm test`.
- Generated ignore files include detected submodule paths and framework build
  outputs. Re-running setup must preserve user-owned files and content.

**Testing approach:** Tests use real filesystem with temp directories (no mocks). `createTempGitRepo()` is the standard test setup helper.

**Publishing:** Never run `npm publish` manually. GitHub Actions handles publishing via trusted publishing when `package.json` version changes on `main`.

## Running the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests (40+ files, ~2-3 min)
QAA_DEVELOPER=true npm test

# Fast unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Single test file
NODE_ENV=test QAA_DEVELOPER=true node tests/licensing.test.js

# CLI smoke test (dry run — no changes)
node setup.js --dry-run

# Validate before release
npm run prerelease

# Deploy to consumer repos (after publishing)
./scripts/deploy-consumers.sh --canary <repo> --canary-only       # validate
./scripts/deploy-consumers.sh --canary <repo> --canary-only --pr  # prepare protected PR
./scripts/deploy-consumers.sh --skip-canary --pr                  # remaining PRs after canary merge
```

## Agent Gotchas

- **`QAA_DEVELOPER=true`** must be set for most tests — it bypasses license checks. Without it, tests fail with license errors.
- **Never `npm publish` manually** — GitHub trusted publishing only. Use `npm version patch/minor/major` + push tags.
- **Template changes affect 15+ consumer repos** — always run `tests/consumer-workflow-integration.test.js` after template edits.
- **`\s` in YAML regexes will collapse newlines** — use `[ \t]*` for any whitespace-trimming regex on YAML content.
- **Coverage thresholds:** 75% lines, 70% functions, 65% branches (enforced by `c8`).
- **No Vitest/Jest** — tests use Node's built-in `assert` module and are run directly with `node tests/*.test.js`.
- **Pre-push hook** runs lint, format, a secret scan, and the production dependency audit only when dependency files changed. Affected tests run through the revision-bound CI policy.
- **`.claude` directory** already exists (has prior workspace data) — do not overwrite its contents.

## Active Development Areas

From recent git log:

- Dependency updates (Dependabot active)
- CI cost optimization (minute budget guardrails, monthly vs weekly security scans)
- Staged rollout / canary deployment for consumer updates
- Vercel Blob integration for webhook handler (replacing filesystem storage)
- Documentation consistency improvements

Deploy `webhook-handler.js` to process Polar.sh subscription events and issue signed Pro licenses automatically.

## Overview

The payment flow:

1. Customer purchases Pro at your landing page → Polar.sh hosted checkout
2. Polar fires a `subscription.created` (and shortly after, `subscription.active`) webhook to your server
3. `webhook-handler.js` verifies the signature, generates a signed license key, and saves it to Vercel Blob
4. Customer runs `npx create-qa-architect@latest --activate-license` and enters their key
5. CLI fetches the public signed registry from Vercel Blob, verifies the signature offline using the bundled `public-key.pem`, and unlocks Pro features

## Prerequisites

- A [Polar.sh](https://polar.sh) organization
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account (for Blob storage and hosting the webhook)
- Node.js >= 20
- The RSA private key used to sign licenses (paired with the `public-key.pem` bundled in the npm package)

---

## Step 1: Create Polar products

In the [Polar Dashboard](https://polar.sh/dashboard) → your org → Products → New Product:

- Name: **QA Architect Pro**
- Description: _(your marketing copy)_
- Type: Subscription
- Prices: add **two** recurring prices under the same product
  - $29.00 USD / month (recurring monthly)
  - $290.00 USD / year (recurring yearly)

Save the **product ID** — you'll need it for `POLAR_PRO_PRODUCT_ID` below. Single product, two prices means one tier mapping regardless of billing cadence.

## Step 2: Create the Polar webhook

In the Polar Dashboard → Settings → Webhooks → New Webhook:

- URL: `https://<your-vercel-domain>/webhook` (we'll deploy this next)
- Events to subscribe to:
  - `subscription.created`
  - `subscription.active`
  - `subscription.updated`
  - `subscription.canceled`
  - `subscription.revoked`
- Save the **signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`) — you'll need it for `POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## Step 3: Set up Vercel Blob storage

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel link
# Dashboard → Storage → Create → Blob → name it "qa-architect-license-private"
# Set access to Private and copy its read/write token.
# Create a separate Public Blob store for the signed public registry.
```

## Step 4: Deploy `webhook-handler.js` to Vercel

`webhook-handler.js` exports an Express app compatible with Vercel serverless.

Create `vercel.json` in the repo root:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "webhook-handler.js", "use": "@vercel/node" }],
  "routes": [{ "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/webhook-handler.js" }]
}
```

Set environment variables in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Settings → Environment Variables):

| Variable                                | Value                                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`                  | `whsec_...` from Step 2                                              |
| `POLAR_PRO_PRODUCT_ID`                  | Pro product ID from Step 1                                           |
| `LICENSE_REGISTRY_PRIVATE_KEY`          | Contents of `private-key.pem` (paired with bundled `public-key.pem`) |
| `LICENSE_REGISTRY_KEY_ID`               | An ID for this signing key (e.g., `prod-2026-05`)                    |
| `LICENSE_PRIVATE_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` | Read/write token from the private license-database Blob store        |
| `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`                 | Read/write token from the public signed-registry Blob store          |
| `STATUS_API_TOKEN`                      | _(optional)_ Bearer token for `/status` debug endpoint               |

Then deploy:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Update the Polar webhook URL (Step 2) to point at the deployed Vercel URL.

## Step 5: Wire your landing page to Polar checkout

On `buildproven.ai/qa-architect`, replace any old Stripe checkout buttons with Polar checkout links:

- Monthly: `https://polar.sh/<org-slug>/<product-slug>?price=<price-id-monthly>`
- Annual: `https://polar.sh/<org-slug>/<product-slug>?price=<price-id-annual>`

Or use Polar's embeddable checkout component for an in-page experience.

## Step 6: Smoke test

```bash
# In the Polar dashboard, send a test webhook event for subscription.created
# (Settings → Webhooks → [your endpoint] → Send Test Event)

# Verify the license appeared:
curl https://<your-vercel-domain>/health
# → { "status": "ok", "database": "exists" }

curl https://<your-vercel-domain>/api/licenses/qa-architect.json
# → JSON with one signed license entry

# Activate locally:
npx create-qa-architect@latest --activate-license
# Enter the test license key. Should report PRO tier.
```

For a real end-to-end test, use Polar's test mode (every webhook can be replayed from the dashboard) before going live. Verify that the private store contains the customer record, the public registry contains only signed entries and email hashes, and that the CLI can activate the issued key.

## Step 7: Verify revocation works

```bash
# Cancel a test subscription in Polar (or use "Send Test Event" with subscription.canceled, then subscription.revoked)

# Verify license moved out of public registry:
curl https://<your-vercel-domain>/api/licenses/qa-architect.json
# → revoked key should be absent
```

An **already-activated** CLI re-checks the signed registry on a cadence
(default every 7 days; override with `QAA_LICENSE_REVALIDATE_DAYS`). On the
next re-check after revocation it downgrades to FREE and prints a reactivation
message. The re-check **fails open when offline** — a paying user is never
locked out without a network connection; only a successful, signature-verified
fetch that finds the key missing or `status: "revoked"` causes a downgrade.

### Optional: nudge users onto the latest CLI

Set `minRecommendedVersion` in the signed registry `_metadata` (server-side,
when you build the registry) to a semver string. On the periodic re-check, any
Pro CLI older than that prints a loud but **non-fatal** "update available"
warning. Leave it unset to disable. It never blocks execution.

## Rollback

If you need to roll back to Stripe-direct: restore the previous `webhook-handler.js` from git (it's the same Express app + Blob layout, just a different event source). Existing signed licenses in Vercel Blob keep working — they're product-agnostic.

## Common issues

**Signature verification fails** — the raw body parser must come _before_ `express.json()` for the `/webhook` route. `webhook-handler.js` does this on line ~125 (`app.use('/webhook', express.raw(...))`).

**`POLAR_PRO_PRODUCT_ID` mismatch** — log `event.data.product?.id || event.data.product_id` in the handler to confirm the exact ID Polar sends. Update the env var to match.

**License doesn't unlock Pro features** — check that `public-key.pem` bundled in your published npm package matches the private key in `LICENSE_REGISTRY_PRIVATE_KEY` on the server. They must be a pair.

**Customer canceled but key still works** — Polar fires `subscription.canceled` immediately, but the key stays valid until `subscription.revoked` fires (typically at `current_period_end`). This is intentional: the customer paid through the end of the period. After `subscription.revoked` removes the key from the registry, an activated CLI drops to FREE on its next periodic re-check (see Step 7) — not necessarily on the customer's very next run.

# QA Architect assurance rule catalog

Rule pack: `2.1.0`

This catalog is generated from the shipped Semgrep rule files. It describes supported static checks, not a claim of complete application security.

## Limitations

- Rules detect only the documented static patterns in supported languages.
- A clean scan does not prove the absence of vulnerabilities.
- Authorization, runtime configuration, and data isolation may require runtime evidence or human review.

## Next.js SaaS assurance pack

Pack contract: `web-saas@1.2.0`

Stack detection selects only checks applicable to declared dependencies or recognized repository markers. Runtime checks remain explicit evidence requirements; they are not silently treated as passing static analysis.

- This pack measures only the documented static patterns and named runtime evidence requirements.
- A clean result does not certify framework security, authorization, tenant isolation, or payment correctness.
- Row-level security, cache isolation, webhook replay resistance, and deployed configuration require runtime evidence.

This rule covers DROP TABLE, DROP COLUMN, and TRUNCATE in recognized migration paths; it does not classify every possible data-rewriting statement. |
